# E-commerce Back End Starter Code
Description This project aims to develop a robust backend system for an e-commerce website. The backend will utilize the latest technologies to provide efficient and competitive services in the internet retail industry.

User Story I want a backend for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies so that my company can compete with other e-commerce companies.

Acceptance Criteria Given a functional Express.js API When I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file, then I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize. When I enter schema and seed commands, then a development database is created and is seeded with test data. When I enter the command to invoke the application, then my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database. When I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags, then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON. When I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core, then I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database. Installation Clone the repository to your local machine. Install dependencies using npm install.
